# React Native Live Coding Challenge

Before joining the live coding challenge, you should have set up the local environments for the application.

# Setup

- Install the packages with `npm i`.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.
- Execute `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to install the app in android or ios simulator. You decide which one to use.

Also, we recommend you read the code so that you are not caught off guard.

# What does the live coding looks like?

The live coding session will be more like a pair programming exercise, we will request you to implement a feature, solve bugs or give code advice. You will be able to use google and any documentation that can help you. Instructions will be provided in the live coding session.
